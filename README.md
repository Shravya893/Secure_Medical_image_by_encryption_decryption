# Secure_Medical_image_by_encryption_decryption

This project demonstrates secure medical image encryption and decryption using a chaotic JSMP map combined with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).  
The interface is built with Streamlit, making it easy to test and visualize the encryption process.

 Features
- ECC Key Generation – Generate public/private key pairs.
- Private Key Sharing – Send private key securely to receiver via email.
- Medical Image Encryption – Encrypt uploaded images using chaotic map-based XOR operation.
- Decryption with Private Key – Only the correct ECC private key allows decryption.
- Analysis Tools – Histogram comparison, MSE, and PSNR calculation.
- Download Encrypted Images – Save encrypted files for secure transmission.
